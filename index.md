# Intro to MarkDown

**Markdown is a plain text formatting syntax aimed at making writing for the internet easier. The philosophy behind Markdown is that plain text documents should be readable without tags mussing everything up, but there should still be ways to add text modifiers like lists, bold, italics, etc. It is an alternative to WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) editors, which use rich text that later gets converted to proper HTML.**

## Why and where we can use MarkDown 

**Markdown can be used for everything. People use it to CREATE:**
- Websites
- Notes
- Books
- Presentations
- Technical documentation

**Markdown is portable. Files containing Markdown-formatted text can be opened using virtually any application**

### In this Chapter we will create a simple website using markdown syntax

1. Open your visual studio and craete a file ndex.md for markdown. Inside your file create a Heading tag with text describing yourself. The code to create a heading tag is below.

## Hello world, Tanyaradzwa is my name. I am 21 year old lady based in a small town called Harare in Zimbabwe. I am a Web Developer at Uncommon.org, learning/working to be a fullstack developer.

**I am proud to be one of the youngest ladies in the tech industry. It's not any easy field to venture into but l work hard everyday to make my family proud, especially my son.**
