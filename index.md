# Intro to MarkDown

**Markdown is a plain text formatting syntax aimed at making writing for the internet easier. The philosophy behind Markdown is that plain text documents should be readable without tags mussing everything up, but there should still be ways to add text modifiers like lists, bold, italics, etc. It is an alternative to WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) editors, which use rich text that later gets converted to proper HTML.**


## Why and where we can use MarkDown 

**Markdown can be used for everything. People use it to CREATE:**
- Websites
- Notes

**Markdown is portable. Files containing Markdown-formatted text can be opened using virtually any application**
